# Pattern-Recognition-COVID
Final project for my Pattern Recognition class. Made in collaboration with [Mgczacki](https://github.com/Mgczacki) and [roher1727](https://github.com/roher1727). The original dataset is in [COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset](http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/). 

The models and the weights can be downloaded (see the [Predictions and performance](https://github.com/davidguzmanr/Pattern-Recognition-COVID/blob/main/Notebooks/Predictions%20and%20performance.ipynb) notebook), so there is no need to train the models again.
